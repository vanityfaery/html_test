    <p>Hello there! If you haven't noticed yet, this is a throwaway HTML where I practice for Odin. One of the assigments says I need to redo everything, type slowly the right code, until I only rely on my own understanding. I really hope I am doing this right. I did this several years ago in one of my 8th and 9th grade classes, but that was it. I completely forgot about HTML at all. I am also gonna push this file to GitHub so that I can see my progress all throughout this journey. Whatever, whatever, whatever.</p>
